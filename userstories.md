Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

As a reminder, user stories typically take the form of, "As X, I want Y, so that Z" but do not necessarily need that structure.

As a marketing research member I want to determine which product to include in our final bus mall app so we can  
increase the 
amount of product sold. As a marketing research member I want to find which products the consumer wants to use / 
purchase to make the customer experience pleasurable. As a marketing research member i want to maximize profitability with the bus mall product so that we can expand past Seattle metro bus system. As a marketing research member I want to make sure I have enough data compiled to confirm with a 98% confidence level that the products I place will be purchased.

As a developer I want to create a site that meets the marketing team's desired product placement so that as a company
 we can move past the start up phase. As a developer I want to display my coding knowledge by exceeding all functional requirements presented by the marketing team so they will continue to use my services. As a developer i want to ensure that all testing is completed to make sure the site is fully functional so the consumer buys products. As a developer I want to follow the site layout provided by the marketing team (ties with functional requirements).

As a focus group member I want to ensure that I click on the products that appeal to my interest so I can see those products in the bus mall. As a focus group member I want to have a user friendly experience so i do not get frustrated and stop working on the focus group.
